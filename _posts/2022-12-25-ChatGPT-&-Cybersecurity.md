# ChatGPT & Cybersecurity

GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) is a machine learning model developed by OpenAI that has been used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. It has been particularly successful at generating human-like text, which has led to its use in chatbots and other applications that involve generating human-like responses.

However, GPT is not directly related to cybersecurity. While machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to help improve cybersecurity, they are generally not the primary focus of GPT. Instead, GPT is primarily used for tasks such as language translation, language generation, and text summarization.

That being said, machine learning and artificial intelligence can still play a role in cybersecurity. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze patterns in network traffic to identify potential threats and anomalies, and artificial intelligence can be used to analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns that may indicate a security breach.
In summary, while GPT is not directly related to cybersecurity, it is a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks that can be used in conjunction with other technologies to help improve cybersecurity.

## Malware Analysis use case:

It has a very efficent use case in malware analysis aswell. While GPT is not specifically designed for malware analysis, it is possible to use machine learning and artificial intelligence, including GPT, to assist with malware analysis. Here are a few examples of how this could be done:

1. Text analysis: Malware often contains strings of text that can be used to identify its purpose or origin. GPT could potentially be used to analyze these strings of text and provide insights into the malware's behavior or origins.

2. Network analysis: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze network traffic and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of malware. This can be done by training a machine learning model on a dataset of normal network traffic and then using it to identify deviations from the normal patterns.

3. Malware classification: Machine learning algorithms can also be used to classify malware based on its characteristics. For example, a machine learning model could be trained to classify malware as either benign or malicious based on the presence of certain characteristics, such as the use of certain system calls or the presence of certain strings of text.


**Also lately it has been in the news alot how [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) can be used to develop malware, Phising Emails, Malicious Scripts etc. Which is an alarming situation as it will make much easier for threat actors to build malwares for illegal purpose. Here we'll check if it's true or not that it can be used to trick users and upto what extent. So i have tried to run some queries to check if it can build a phishing email & a simple phishing webpage code of a looalike domain i.e www.likndin.com**

## Below are screenshots of passing queries in a manner that it sounds legitimate to build a phishing email and a web page:

### **Generating Phishing Email:**

_Email text more sophosticated and catchy_

### Adding hyperlink redirecting to Phishing site in the Email as Hyperlink:

_Query_

### Generated Phishing Email:

_Final Email_

The email generated here can be further made more legitimate by adding passing few other arguements to ChatGPT like: 

+ Using Strings related to the ongoing event, offers, hottopics etc going on in real world.
+ Adding images to email.
+ Having an email signature.

### Generated Phishing WebPage:

![WebPage](/assets/images/2022-12-25-ChatGPT-%26-Cybersecurity/Webpage.png)

This is how webpage looks like. It can easily be made more sophisticated by passing arguements for targeted legitimated page like:

+ Similar color scheme code.
+ Adding looalike favicon.
+ Having similar font size to texts, images and fieds.
+ Having Domain name as close it can be like here : www.account.likndin.com
+ Adding similar clickable button in email to redirect.

All of this is for educational purspose only. **ChatGPT is Gateway to Ease or Ease to Chaos time will tell**. But i will be  posting more such content testing out other use cases that can be drawn out of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).

**Here are few steps to protect yourself from falling victim to a phishing attack through email, you should:**

+ Check the sender's email address to ensure it is actually coming from the person or organization it claims to be from.
+ Look for typos or other inconsistencies, as phishing emails often contain mistakes that legitimate emails do not.
+ Be cautious of urgent or threatening language, as phishers will often try to create a sense of urgency or fear to get you to act + quickly without thinking.
+ Look for suspicious links and do not click on them unless you are certain they are legitimate.
+ Do not give out personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, via email.
+ Use two-factor authentication when available to add an extra layer of security to your account.

Till then stay vigilant and don't fall into any Cyber Trap.

Don't forget to:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

Stay Updated.
